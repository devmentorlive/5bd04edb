# Build a RPG Map Editor in React (part 1) [Drag n Drop, Matrices, useState]

In this screencast we will be building the map editor we will need for our RPG. You will learn how to implement drag and drop, how to use matrices, and of course, useState, and useEffect. We will also be implementing drag as a custom React hook!
